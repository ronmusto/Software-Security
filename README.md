# Software-Security
My client wanted me to improve the security of their program and have it be able to launch over the internet. I think that what I did the best was to choose a good algorithm cipher and to make sure that I covered all of the potential security risks that were associated with the particular program. I think that the flowchart provided to me was very helpful in determining the potential vulnerabilities that my program had. It helped me keep clear where the main issue would typically arise. I ran dependency checks as well as conducting manual reviews of my code to ensure that I did not introduce any security issues and that all my dependent software libraries were up to date and secure. I think the most useful tool I learned about is how to generate a self signed certificate and how to use the Maven dependency check tool. I think that in particular I would like to showcase my code from this project to a future employer because I am very proud of how well it all runs.
